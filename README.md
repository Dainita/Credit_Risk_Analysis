# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
To determine credit card risk, different techniques were employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries
are used to build and evaluate the models using resampling. The models are then compared to determine the effectiveness of determining credit risk
